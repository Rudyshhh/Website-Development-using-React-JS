A website  developed using React JS.

The website that we're referring to here is a blog site that consists of several web pages. The developers used React components to build the website, which was a smart choice as it allowed for efficient and modular development. Additionally, they used React Router for seamless navigation between different pages, ensuring a smooth user experience. However, before anyone can use the website, they must first make sure that all the necessary node modules are installed.
